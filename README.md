# ACE - Analysis Correlation Engine

At it's core, ACE is the implementation of a detection strategy. ACE's implementation of this strategy has proven successful enough for ACE to become much more than a boom for the security analyst, it's become the foundation to an entire security ecosystem.


ACE is ..
+ an automation framework
+ a tool set for detection

ACE does ..
+ turn alert's into "stories" for the analyst ~ "This is everything that happened and this is how everything this related, what do you think?"

ACE is not..
+ A SIEM

```python
from humans import commonSense, reason, emotion, context, knowledge, experience # can't do this

from computer import analyze.all.the.things # can do this
```

John Davison gave a talk on the development of this tool set at Bsides Cincinnati in 2015. You can see his talk below.
