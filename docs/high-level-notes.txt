 
What do we consider to be high-level tip toe?

The tip-toe high-level items need to be focused on the problem ACE solves for the analyst and the security team. 
That problem is reducing the time it takes analyst to disposition false positive alerts and recognize true positive alerts.

So, need to cover observable analysis and correlation right from the git-go. Make the analysts understand that this tool makes their job easier. 

Next, maybe maybe at the tip-toe is hunting and tuning to increase the attack surface.

    Hunting + Tunning == Coverage++

Idea -> Postulate -> Strategy -> Tactic -> Tool
